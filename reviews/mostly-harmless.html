      <i>Mostly Harmless Econometrics</i> is an admittedly narrow, but very unique and fun to read textbook on modern (reduced form) micro-econometrics. If one wants to understand the <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.2.3">credibility revolution</a><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> in modern economics, and where it's led us, they should start here.

        The title of this paper, by the same authors of the book, is a nod to a famous <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/economics/1983-leamer.pdf">article</a> by the late Ed Leamer, which set off a slow turn away from model-based inference towards design-based inference. The former represents a primary concern for correctly specified economic models as a pretext for unbiased effect estimates; the latter is instead concerned with independence/exogeneity and randomization. Angrist and Pischke clearly take inspiration from Leamer, first introducing the study of observational data with regression as an <i>analogue</i> of controlled, randomized experiments. Leamer's article has aged very well, and is well worth reading today.
