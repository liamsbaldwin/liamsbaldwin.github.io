      <h1>Uncommon Sense</h1>
      <p><em>by Gary Becker & Richard Posner</em></p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Uncommon Sense is a compilation of lightly edited posts of the Becker-Posner blog, which is currently down. With each chapter Becker, a nobellaureate in economics — or Posner,  the most highly cited legal scholar of all time (https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/01_ESSAY_SHAPIRO.pdf) (though he may have since been passed by Cass Sunstein) — react to a timely policy issue, often using price theory or law & econ reasoning to make predictions or policy arguments. The other author responds thereafter. Given the authors' backgrounds, I was already familiar with them, but I must admit that this was the first book of theirs I've read, if one can really call it that. For both authors I can say I'm often unable to predict their position on any given issue, and I believe taht to be a very good sign (I often try, when reading essays or blogs, to anticipate the argument a given public figure will make. If I can routinely do so, why should I even read them?). The essays are grouped into six sections, based on the broad topic. Below are my brief thoughts on each.
