      <h1>Working</h1>

      I <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/lyndon-johnson">heard</a> that I <i>must</i> read Robert Caro's multi-volume biograpgy of Lyndon Johnson. These books are exactly the opposite of the kind I typically read (despite still being nonfiction; it's going to be very diffficult get me to break from that habit even once), so I went ahead and ordered the first volume. When ordering it, ThriftBooks<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> suggested also a shorter book by Caro, titled <i>Working</i>. I figured that—if a guy can write so well about people like LBJ and Robert Moses, so well that even I was compelled to read their works—I could gain a lot from understanding explicitly what sets them apart in their craft.

      <p>
      I am working my way through the book, and I'll write down my thoughts here when I finish in a few days.

      I very seldom hear it mentioned, but <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/">ThriftBooks</a> is an incredible site for purchasing used books, especially more niche acadmeic works or textbooks.
